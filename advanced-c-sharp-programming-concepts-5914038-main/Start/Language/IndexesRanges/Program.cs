// Indexes and Ranges example

// Define a sample array 
string[] words = [
    "The","quick","brown","fox","jumps",
    "over","the","lazy","dog"       
];

// The index operator provides access to array elements
Console.WriteLine(words[1]);

// The index-from-end operator indexes from the end of a sequence
// (Note that the end is not zero-based, ^1 is the last item)


// The range operator (..) defines a range


// Indexes and ranges can be variables too
